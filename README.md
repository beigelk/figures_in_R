# Making Figures in R
This repo contains instructions and code for how to make a variety of different figures in R for bioinformatics visualizations.

Each subfolder contains a minimal example of how to generate figures. The examples either use the base datasets in R (`iris`, `mtcars`, etc.) or have an exmaple input file. For simple analysis, there are instructions on how to generate the results. For more complicated analyses, there are links to another repo on how to perform the analysis.
