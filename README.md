# Making Figures in R
This repo contains instructions and code for how to make a variety of different figures in R for bioinformatics visualizations.

Each subfolder contains a minimal example of how to generate figures. There should be an example input file. For simple analysis, there are instructions on how to generate the results. For more complicated analysis, there are links to another repo on how to perform the analysis.
